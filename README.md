# 3D Particle System

A simple Three.js particle scene with 200 animated particles that smoothly change size and opacity while regenerating over time.

## Running locally
Open `index.html` in a modern browser. The page pulls Three.js from a CDN, so no build step is required. For best results, serve the folder with a static server (e.g., `python -m http.server 8000`) and visit `http://localhost:8000`.
